## Machine Learnig project --> Heart Desicse Detection

❤️ Heart Disease Detection System
A machine learning-powered web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user-provided medical data. Built using Flask for the frontend and various ML models on the backend, this project aims to provide quick and accurate heart disease detection.

📌 Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning algorithms to detect heart disease from a set of 14 medical features. The goal is to build a reliable prediction model and deliver it through a user-friendly web interface.

📊 Dataset
Total Samples: 820

Features: 14 medical attributes (e.g., age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.)

Split:

70% Training

30% Testing

🧠 Machine Learning Models
The system utilizes multiple algorithms to build and evaluate models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Model performance is measured using:

Accuracy

R-squared (R²)

🔧 Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameters are optimized using GridSearchCV to find the best configuration for each model.
